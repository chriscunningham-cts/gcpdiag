  Instance groups named ports are using unique names.

**Product**: [Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute)\
**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is possibly wrong

### Description

Named ports are key-value pairs that represent a port's name and number.
It is recommended to use unique port name for the same application, so that
backend service can only forward traffic to one named port at a time.
