**Product**: [Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute)\
**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is possibly wrong

### Description

The messages:
"No space left on device" / "I/O error" / "No usable temporary directory found"
in serial output usually indicate that the disk is full.

### Remediation

Delete some files or increase the size of the disk.

You can use the following log query to find matching log lines:

```
resource.type="gce_instance"
log_id("serialconsole.googleapis.com/serial_port_1_output")
textPayload:(
  "No space left on device"
  OR
  "I/O error"
  OR
  "No usable temporary directory found"
  )
```
