  Per-project quotas are not near the limit.

**Product**: [Quotas](https://cloud.google.com/docs/quota)\
**Rule class**: WARN - Something that is possibly wrong

### Description

Google Cloud uses quotas to restrict how much of a particular shared Google
Cloud resource that you can use. Each quota represents a specific countable
resource.

Project level quota limits the resources you can use in each project, such as
the number of VPCs you can create.

Rule will start failing if quota usage will be higher then configured threshold
 (80%).
