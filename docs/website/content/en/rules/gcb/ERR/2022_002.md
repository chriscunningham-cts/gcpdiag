**Product**: [Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/build)\
**Rule class**: ERR - Something that is very likely to be wrong

### Description

Builds configured to upload image to Artifact Registry must use service account  that has write
permission for it.

### Remediation

You can resolve this error by granting IAM role
to the used service account. If you did not specify service account for this
build, then it used default one: [PROJECT_NUMBER]@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com.
