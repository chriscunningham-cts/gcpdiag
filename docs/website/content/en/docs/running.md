  Prerequisites and how to run gcpdiag.
---

## Pre-requisites

gcpdiag requires the following in order to be able to run correctly:

#### 1. Permissions

The credentials that you use with gcpdiag needs to have at minimum the
following roles granted (both of them):

- `Viewer` on the inspected project
- `Service Usage Consumer` on the project used for billing/quota enforcement,
  which is per default the project being inspected, but can be explicitely set
  using the `--billing-project` option

The Editor and Owner roles include all the required permissions, but we
recommend that if you use service account authentication (`--auth-key`), you
only grant the Viewer+Service Usage Consumer on that service account.

#### 2. Required APIs

gcpdiag requires some APIs to be enabled in order for the inspection of
resources to work correctly:

- `cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com` *(Cloud Resource Manager API)*
- `iam.googleapis.com` *(Identity and Access Management API)*
- `logging.googleapis.com` *(Cloud Logging API)*
- `serviceusage.googleapis.com` *(Service Usage API)*

You can enable these APIs using Cloud Console or via command-line:

```
gcloud --project=MYPROJECT services enable \
    cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com \
    iam.googleapis.com \
    logging.googleapis.com \
    serviceusage.googleapis.com

```

## Running in Cloud Shell

gcpdiag is integrated in Cloud Shell:

```
gcpdiag lint --project=MYPROJECT
```

## Running with Docker

You can run gcpdiag using a shell wrapper that starts gcpdiag in a Docker
container. This should work on any machine with Docker or Podman installed.

```
curl https://gcpdiag.dev/gcpdiag.sh >gcpdiag
chmod +x gcpdiag
./gcpdiag lint --project=MYPROJECT
```
